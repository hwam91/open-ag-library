The CPI dataset is published at the country, subregional, regional and income group levels.","DatasetDescription":"The FAOSTAT monthly Food CPI and General CPI database was based on the ILO CPI data until December 2014. In 2014, IMF-ILO-FAO agreed to transfer global CPI data compilation from ILO to IMF. Upon agreement, CPIs for all items and its subcomponents originates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) for countries not covered by the IMF. However, due to a limited time coverage from IMF and UNSD for a number of countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Central Bank of Western African States (BCEAO), Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), UNdata, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the national statistics offices websites databases are used for filling the missing data of Food and General CPI. The FAO CPI dataset for all items (or General CPI) and the Food CPI, consists of a complete and consistent set of time series from January 2000 onwards. Data gaps on monthly Food CPI and General CPI are filled using statistical estimation procedures to have full data coverage for all countries for Food CPI and for General CPI. These indices measure the price change between the current and reference periods of the average basket of goods and services purchased by households. The General CPI is typically used to measure and monitor inflation, set monetary policy targets, index social benefits such as pensions and unemployment benefits, and to escalate thresholds and credits in the income tax systems and wages in public and private wage contracts. The FAOSTAT monthly Food CPI inflation rates are annual year-over-year inflation or percentage change over corresponding month of the previous year. The regional and subregional Food and General CPI, and the aggregated Food and General CPI at the different income levels (High-income economies, Low-income economies, Lower-middle-income economies and Upper-middle-income economies) are calculated using two different statistical methods:1- A weighted average of Food and General CPI values of countries and territories within each region using the weights of Household final consumption expenditure (including non-profit institutions serving households) in 2015 in USD at constant prices of 2015. Household final consumption expenditure is available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama2- Median of Food and General CPI values of countries and territories within each region.The Food CPI inflation rates for regional, subregional, and income groups are calculated by first computing, at the country level, the monthly percentage change between two consecutive years. These country-level inflation rates are then aggregated to the group level using two alternative methods: the median and the weighted average, whose weights are based on household final consumption expenditure at 2015 constant prices.","Contact":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): Statistics Division (ESS), Social and Economic Statistics Team","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2025-12-23T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"2234KB","FileRows":237814,"FileLocation":"https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/ConsumerPriceIndices_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"CS","DatasetName":"Macro-Economic Indicators: Capital Stock","Topic":"Capital stock in the agricultural sector covers data on domestic Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), Consumption of Fix Capital (CFC), Net Capital Stock (NCS) in the Agricultural sector and derived indicators, including Agricultural Investment Ratio (AIR) and Agricultural Orientation Index for GFCF (AOI), from 1995 to 2023. The dataset covers 195 countries.","DatasetDescription":"As part of the FAO Agriculture Capital Stock (ACS) database, the Statistics Division of FAO publishes country-by-country data on physical investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing as measured by the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index. The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). The database is further supplemented by OECD Structural Analysis database (OECD STAN) and, in a few cases, data from country’s statistics websites. If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official submissions by Member Countries. With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a constant geometric depreciation rate is employed to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period). In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. An attempt is made to rely as much as possible on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, econometric techniques to impute missing observations are employed. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (from among the ARIMAX, PANEL regression, and OLS approaches) for the data series from 1995 to 2022.The values of Agriculture Capital Stock related indicators for 2023, including Agriculture Investment Ratio, Agriculture Orientation Index, Net Capital Stock, Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Consumption of Fixed Capital, are estimated using the Holt-Winters (HW) method (Cipra et al., 1995). The HW method is an exponential smoothing method for forecasting the annual values of economic variables. In this context, the HW method relies on existing (historical) values of the Agriculture Capital Stock. The predicted value is an extrapolation of the historical values to the specified target date, which extends the timeline without considering seasonality in the annual series.All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2015.","Contact":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): Statistics Division (ESS), Social and Economic Statistics Team","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2025-07-10T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"1381KB","FileRows":144944,"FileLocation":"https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Investment_CapitalStock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"EA","DatasetName":"Investment: Development Flows to Agriculture","Topic":"The dataset covers 208 recipients, including 144 countries classified as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) or upper-middle-income countries, and 64 regions and subregions.The dataset includes 189 donors, comprising bilateral donors (countries), multilateral organizations, and private sector entities (private grants).

FDI may be undertaken by individuals, as well as business entities. The foreign direct investor most often is aiming to gain access to natural resources, to markets, to labour supply, to technology, to ensure security of supplies or to control the quality of a certain product. FDI can be decomposed into two types of investments: mergers and acquisitions (MA) and greenfield investments. The latter type results in the creation of new entities and the setting up of offices, buildings, plants or factories from scratch in a foreign economy. FDI is the sum of equity capital, reinvested earnings and other FDI capital. Equity capital comprises equity in branches, all shares in subsidiaries and associates (except non-participating, preferred shares that are treated as debt securities and are included under other FDI capital) and other contributions such as the provision of machinery. Reinvested earnings consist of the direct investor's share (in proportion to equity participation) of earnings not distributed by the direct investment enterprise. Other FDI capital (loans) includes the borrowing and lending of funds, including debt securities and trade credits between direct investors and direct investment enterprises. FDI inflows and outflows are important for tracking the direct investment conditions each year. Outward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows record the value of cross-border direct investment transactions from the reporting economy during a year.

The trade database includes the following variables: export quantity, export value, import quantity, and import value. It includes all food and agricultural products imported/exported annually by all the countries in the world.","Contact":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): Statistics Division (ESS), Crops, Livestock and Food Statistics Team","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2025-12-23T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"410792KB","FileRows":52410630,"FileLocation":"https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Trade_DetailedTradeMatrix_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"WCAD","DatasetName":"World Census of Agriculture: Structural data from agricultural censuses","Topic":"This domain provides access to structural data from censuses of agriculture conducted by FAO member countries and territories during various WCA rounds (WCA 1930, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020). Disseminated indicators include the number and area of holdings by land size classes; number of parcels and average number of parcels per holding; sex of agricultural holders; number and area of holdings by land tenure types; number and area of holdings by legal status of the holder; demography of farms and source of farm labour. The domain also includes number of holdings, total area of holdings and average area of holdings. Data are aggregated at the national level.","DatasetDescription":"Data from censuses of agriculture are collected at holding level and provide information about the structure of agriculture of a country or a territory (e.g. size and number of holdings, land tenure, legal status, and sex of the holder). According to WCA 2020 ''An agricultural holding is an economic unit of agricultural production under single management comprising all livestock kept, and all land used wholly or partly for agricultural production purposes''. However, countries may apply their own definitions of agricultural holdings, which could affect the international comparability of census data. National censuses are conducted at least once every ten years. The \"Structural data from agricultural censuses\" domain in FAOSTAT provides structural data from the WCA rounds (WCA 1930, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020) for each participating country and territory, to the extent possible. The data are prepared based on the national census reports and other dissemination products available in the public domain or directly provided by member countries to FAO, also disseminated by FAO through its census-related publications, and recent methodological review of the available country census data of WCA 2020 round.","Contact":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): Statistics Division (ESS), Agricultural Census Team","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2025-06-25T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"309KB","FileRows":23390,"FileLocation":"https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/World_Census_Agriculture_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}]
